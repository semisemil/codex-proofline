# Issue Ledger v2

Read this reference for normal update operation shapes, reviewed migration, schema repair, or tool maintenance. Creation from templates does not require the full reference. Resolve `<skill-dir>` to the directory containing this skill and run the CLI from the project root.

## Canonical groups

- `schema_version: 2`
- `identity`: `id`, `aliases`, `type`, `mode`, `title`, `risk`
- `origin`: registration `kind`, short `summary`, and `refs`
- `state`: `status`, `current_summary`, and conditional active-state fields
- `problem`: `bug | research` claims and impact
- `objective`: requested-work goal and constraints
- `criteria`: independently verifiable C-ID conditions
- `milestones`: composite-only M-ID outcomes
- `relations`: directional issue links
- `context`: related files or documents that do not prove a judgment
- `artifacts`: external reports, full logs, tables, hashes, and methods
- `evidence`: immutable E-ID observations
- `events`: immutable D-ID decisions and T-ID state transitions
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

Local IDs are unique only inside one issue. Use `PL-0001#E1` for external reference. P/C/D records reference E-IDs; evidence never owns the judgment mapping.

## State invariants

| Status | Required | Forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open`, `doing` | `current_summary`, `next_action` | blocker fields |
| `blocked` | `current_summary`, `next_action`, `blocker`, `unblock_condition` | — |
| `resolved` | cause/goal-change-result summary; active evidence for every C-ID | active-state fields |
| `cancelled` | termination summary and decision event | active-state fields |
| `superseded` | termination summary, decision event, `superseded_by` | active-state fields |

Bug and research P-claims use `reported | confirmed | refuted`. Confirmed and refuted claims require current evidence. Requested work uses `objective.summary` and `objective.constraints` instead of claims.

Simple issues omit milestones. Composite issues have 3–7 milestones; required milestones must be `done` before resolution. Composite parents retain coordination and top-level outcome proof only.

Evidence must contain `id`, `kind`, `location`, `observation`, and `observed_at`. Full reproducibility material belongs in an artifact; evidence keeps the judgment-level observation and artifact location. Every evidence item must be referenced by a P-claim, C-criterion, or D-decision.

Decisions may reference earlier D-IDs through `supersedes`. New evidence may reference old E-IDs through `supersedes` or `invalidates`. Current valid decisions are those not superseded by a later decision.

## CLI

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js list [--root DIR] [--all] [--search TEXT]
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js show ID [--root DIR] [--evidence E1,E2] [--events]
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js validate [FILE] [--root DIR]
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js create --input ISSUE.json [--root DIR]
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js update ID --operation OPERATION.json [--root DIR]
node <skill-dir>/scripts/issue-ledger.js link-work ID --help
```

Supported update operation types are `batch`, `set_state`, `add_evidence`, `link_evidence`, `add_event`, `set_milestone`, and `add_relation`. Every update requires one top-level `current_summary` confirmation. Use `batch.operations` when evidence, its P/C/D link, a decision, or a terminal-state change must become valid atomically. `add_evidence.targets` can link a new observation to one or more existing P/C/D IDs in one operation. A changed `set_state` automatically appends a T-ID transition, using `transition_summary` when supplied and otherwise the confirmed current summary. The dedicated `link-work` command validates the Plan or Spec backlink, adds one canonical context path, may update active state, is idempotent, and refuses terminal issues. JSON output uses stable top-level key order and two-space indentation.

Minimal operation shapes:

```json
{"type":"set_state","status":"blocked","current_summary":"...","next_action":"...","blocker":"...","unblock_condition":"...","updated_at":"..."}
{"type":"add_evidence","current_summary":"...","evidence":{"id":"E2","kind":"test","location":"...","observation":"...","observed_at":"..."},"targets":["C1"]}
{"type":"link_evidence","current_summary":"...","target":"D1","evidence_id":"E2"}
{"type":"add_event","current_summary":"...","event":{"id":"D2","kind":"decision","at":"...","summary":"...","evidence_refs":[]}}
{"type":"set_milestone","current_summary":"...","milestone_id":"M2","status":"done"}
{"type":"add_relation","current_summary":"...","relation":{"type":"follow_up_to","target":"PL-0001"}}
```

For an atomic change, put the same inner objects without `current_summary` in order under `{"type":"batch","current_summary":"...","updated_at":"...","operations":[...]}`. When a new decision and its new evidence are created together, add the D-event first, then add evidence targeting that D-ID. Omit active-state fields from a terminal `set_state`; include the cancellation or replacement decision in the same batch.

## Legacy migration

The dashboard and query tool read legacy Markdown without treating its duplicated body as v2 state. Migrate one issue during a meaningful update. Extract the current summary, active next action, claims or objective, completion criteria, effective decisions, direct evidence, relations, and artifact links. Split overgrown scope before conversion. Delete the old Markdown only after the v2 issue validates; Git remains the prose-history source.
